FROM: BaxtonOS
TO: Mr. Zinc

Good evening, sir. I have been continuing my scans of other dimensions as per your request. However, I have noticed an anomaly in #28. The denizens of its prime world call it "Azeroth." This world is steeped in what even we would consider magic, and I have noticed something quite strange; one particular person on this planet has been traveling back and forth between countless universes.

Sir, you're not going to like this, but he is a parallel version of Mr. Wellsworth. And the two duplicates have been in contact. 

Recently they both visited Gangico, as you know Wellsworth has, but as you do not know, they promptly left to the netherspace in between Gangico and Earth Prime. There is a pocket dimension there, and it is filled to the brim with ludicrous amounts of arcane energy. If we could harness this power source, and even study the pocket dimension's inner workings, THINK of everything we could do!

I advise you to look into the matter, but tread cautiously. Wellsworth and the other may be waiting...and with that much power, lord knows what he'll do. 

Might I suggest a visit to Azeroth, to interrogate the duplicate? Or at least examine his notes. There must be something on pocket dimensions there, if he has created one.

Be safe, sir. And be sure to regularly clean your glasses.
