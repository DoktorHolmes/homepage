Abraham Zincari is a THIRD parallel me.  And he apparently has gained access to dimensional travel, then promptly lost it as a cthulhu-demon got
into Gangico and whatever universe he came from.  That universe is probably lost.  

Judging by his outfit, accent, and general personality, he comes from some sort of edgy, gothic universe full of vampires or something.
More investigation needed.
