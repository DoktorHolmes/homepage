Welcome to the BaxtonOS Alpha, brought to you by the Zinc Innovators Corporation!

This system is designed for sharing documents (including text documents and HTML) with other users on the system. 

The database operates in a tier-based system. Level 1 files are accessible to everyone. Level 2 files are accessible to all users with personal accounts. Level 3 files are the top tier and are accessible to authorized users only. Each user also has their own personal files, which are accessible only to them.

If you are using the guest account, you have access to Level 1 files only. Please contact Mr. Zinc if you wish to set up a personal account. 

Currently, files must be approved by Mr. Zinc before being uploaded to the system. 

You may contact Mr. Zinc by emailing him at 'zincinnovators@gmail.com'. 

GETTING STARTED
---------------
When you first load the database, you will be presented with a console. Type "login" to begin, and enter either your username and password or "guest" and "zincnet", respectively. 
Now you will see the home screen.

You may type "HELP" at any time on the main screen to review a list of currently accessible commands. 

Type "LS1" to see a list of all Level 1 files, "LS2" for Level 2 files, and so on.

Once you find a file, you may type "LoadL1 <file name>" to load that Level 1 file into the display below! As you may have guessed, you may type "LoadL2 <file name>" to load a Level 2 file instead. 
"LoadL3 <file name>" is for Level 3 files, by the way. 

"LoadPrivate <file name>" will load a file that only your account can read. 

All uploads go through Mr. Zinc; remember, you can contact him at "zincinnovators@gmail.com".

Thank you for choosing ZincNet!
